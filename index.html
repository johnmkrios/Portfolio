							</header>
							<blockquote>
								“The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.”
								<br />
								― Eleanor Roosevelt
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								My goal is to live life to the maximum, the way I want to live it. I want to spend my time with people that inspire me. 
								Whether it’s by their intellect, abilities, achievements, kindness or compassion.
								I intend to live a life that’s full to the brim with experience and get to a point where I’m financially free and walk through life acting like time is my primary currency.
								You can get more money. You can’t get more time. The fact that it’s ticking steadily away with every moment can be somewhat terrifying, but it motivates me too.
								<br /><br />
								I want to spend as much of my time feeling present as possible. It is all too easy to drift from the here and now.
								I hope to improve my ability to stay rooted in the present in a bid to become more content overall.
								I want to take full control of it. I don’t want others to dictate how I spend my time, unless I’m in a role I’m totally passionate about.
								<br /><br />
								I’m still determined to do some good for others in whatever I end up doing in the future. I aim to regularly remind myself of what I’m grateful for.
								It’s easy to be grateful for the good stuff. The real trick is to find genuine thanks for the hardships that come by too.
